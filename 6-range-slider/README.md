In this project, we're creating a Range Slider. As you move the knob, the dollar amount above will update.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.

Users should be able to: 

- Move the knob on the range and the dollar amount above it will update.
